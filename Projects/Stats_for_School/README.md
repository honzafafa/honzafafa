This Jupyter notebook contains Statistic project for my final year high school math class. 
Topic of the project is investigation of cerrelation between Google stock prize daily change and daily volume of the stock traded. 
Text in the notebook is writen in Czech Languange. 
Overall the simple regression models used in the notebook proved insuficcient to prove any correlation.
